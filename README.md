# üïπÔ∏è Python Tetris

## Introduction
This project is my first endeavor in game development using the Pygame library.
The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Pygame, strengthen my understanding of Python syntax, and improve my overall programming skills.
The project involved implementing the popular game "Tetris" in Python.

## Technologies Used
- Python programming language
- Pygame library

## Project Scope
The project focused on building a functional Tetris game using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, specifically leveraging the concept of inheritance.
The inheritance structure allowed for the creation of modular and reusable code components, enhancing the game's maintainability and scalability.

## Design and Visuals
To enhance the visual appeal of the game, I made deliberate design choices and utilized a color palette to create an engaging and aesthetically pleasing user interface. The color palette selection aimed to ensure good contrast, readability, and an enjoyable gaming experience for players.

## Learning Outcomes
Through the development of this project, I achieved several learning outcomes, including:
- Gained proficiency in using the Pygame library to create interactive games.
- Deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and their application in game development.
- Strengthened my grasp of Python syntax, including control flow, event handling, and graphics rendering.
- Developed skills in designing and implementing game mechanics, such as block movement, rotation, and collision detection.
- Gained experience in managing game states, such as pausing and game over conditions.
- Improved problem-solving skills by tackling challenges specific to game development.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the Python Tetris project served as an excellent opportunity for me to explore game development, refine my programming skills, and gain practical experience in utilizing the Pygame library.
This project has provided a solid foundation for future game development endeavors and has been instrumental in enhancing my understanding of Python syntax, OOP principles, and design choices.
I look forward to further expanding my knowledge and skills in game development through future projects.
